# Object-Oriented To-Do List

The Object-Oriented To-Do List is a versatile and user-friendly task management application built using JavaScript's object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project provides an efficient and organized way to manage your daily tasks, helping you stay productive and organized.


## Key Features

- Object-Oriented Structure: Leveraging the power of OOP, this To-Do List is structured around JavaScript classes and objects, making the codebase modular and easy to maintain.

- Add and Remove Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list and remove them when they're completed, ensuring your to-do list is always up to date.


- Clean and Intuitive Interface: The user interface is designed for simplicity and efficiency, making it easy to navigate and use, even for those new to task management tools.

- Local Storage: Your tasks are saved locally in your browser, so you can close and reopen the application without losing any progress.
